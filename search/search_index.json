In this guided exercise, you will learn how to simulate a novel medical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) detector using Monte Carlo methods and analyze the results. Learning Objectives By the end of this tutorial, you will: - Understand the principles of PET imaging and why simulations are necessary. - Run a Monte Carlo simulation of a PET detector using OpenGATE. - Analyze coincidence events and explore detector performance. - Modify simulation parameters to investigate their impact on data quality. Structure This tutorial is divided into several sections: 1. Background \u2013 Introduction to PET physics and Monte Carlo simulations. 2. Setup \u2013 Installation instructions for necessary software. 3. Step-by-Step Guide \u2013 Running the simulation and understanding the outputs. 4. Data Analysis \u2013 Working with the provided Jupyter notebook. 5. Exercises \u2013 Guided tasks to explore different aspects of the detector. 6. Explore Further \u2013 Open-ended suggestions for independent investigation. Getting Started To begin, head over to the Setup section for installation instructions. Once everything is installed, move on to the Step-by-Step Guide to start running simulations!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#pet-detector-monte-carlo-tutorial","text":"","title":"PET Detector Monte Carlo Tutorial"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Welcome to the PET Detector Monte Carlo Tutorial!
