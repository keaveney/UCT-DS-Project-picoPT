# PET Detector Monte Carlo Tutorial

## Introduction
Welcome to the PET Detector Monte Carlo Tutorial! In this guided exercise, you will learn how to simulate a novel medical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) detector using Monte Carlo methods and analyze the results.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will:
- Understand the principles of PET imaging and why simulations are necessary.
- Run a Monte Carlo simulation of a PET detector using OpenGATE.
- Analyze coincidence events and explore detector performance.
- Modify simulation parameters to investigate their impact on data quality.

## Structure
This tutorial is divided into several sections:
1. **[Background](background.md)** – Introduction to PET physics and Monte Carlo simulations.

2. **Setup** – Installation instructions for necessary software.

3. **[Step-by-Step Guide](tutorial.md)** – Running the simulation and understanding the outputs.

4. **Data Analysis** – Working with the provided Jupyter notebook.

5. **Exercises** – Guided tasks to explore different aspects of the detector.

6. **Explore Further** – Open-ended suggestions for independent investigation.

## Getting Started
To begin, head over to the [Setup](setup.md) section for installation instructions. Once everything is installed, move on to the [Step-by-Step Guide](tutorial.md) to start running simulations!
